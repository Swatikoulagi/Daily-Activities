		Maya had always been afraid of missing the last train. Growing up in the city, she’d heard countless stories of people stranded at the station late at night, their lives altered by a single delay. She was careful, always watching the clock and making sure she never let it slip past 11:45 p.m. But tonight, something was different.
The streets were eerily quiet as she walked towards the station, a soft mist rolling in from the river. She checked her phone: 11:40 p.m. Good. Plenty of time.
She stepped onto the platform, the sound of her heels echoing against the concrete. The usual bustle of the city was gone, replaced by an unsettling stillness. As she waited for the train, she noticed a man sitting alone on a bench, his face hidden in the shadows. She didn’t think much of it—after all, it was late, and people often found themselves alone at odd hours.
When the train finally arrived, Maya felt a sense of relief. She boarded quickly, the doors sliding shut behind her with a soft thud. She grabbed a seat by the window, watching the station fade into the distance.
But as the train pulled away, she realized something strange. The station she had just left didn’t look quite the same. The buildings were older, the streets narrower. It was as though she had crossed into another world altogether.
The man from the bench was sitting across from her now, his face still hidden, but his eyes glowing faintly in the dim light.
"Are you lost?" he asked softly.
Maya swallowed hard, her heart racing. The train rumbled on into the dark, and for the first time, she wasn’t sure if she would ever make it back.
